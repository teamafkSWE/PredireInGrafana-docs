\subsection{ESLint}
ESLint is a plugin used for code static analisys, so it checks for JavaScript syntax errors.

\subsection{InfluxDB}
InfluxDB it'an open source time series database which is used to store and manage data insied the Prediction Plugin. 

\subsection{NodeJS}
NodeJS it's a runtime environment that execute JavaScript code outside a web browser. NodeJS it's useful for the tool's developing.

\subsection{NPM}
NPM or Node Package Manager it's used to manage dependencies and buld automation. All its functionalities are available by the presence of the file package.json. In this project there are two copies of it because each product needs a dedicated package.json file. So tool's configuration and managemant are indipendent from those required for the plugin.

\subsection{React}
