\section{Introduction}

\subsection{General description}
This document is “Predire in Grafana”’s user manual, a project developed by “Team AFK” for use on the Grafana\glo platform.

\subsection{Purpose of the document}
This document’s purpose is to demonstrate how to use Predire in Grafana’s two software components: the training tool and the prediction plug-in for Grafana itself.

\subsection{Predire in Grafana’s Purpose}
Predire in Grafana is a platform which allows users to train linear regression or support vector machine algorithms using machine learning\glo, and then use these algorithms to monitor and predict the behaviour of various systems of their choosing.
In more detail:	
Users can supply a CSV file to the training tool and receive a JSON file containing values which can then be used to set and calibrate SVM\glo or RL\glo algorithms by coupling the values contained in the JSON file with data streams coming from a database.

\subsection{Glossary}
At the end of the document an appendix is available where explanations for new or ambiguous terms can be found. These are marked with a subscript G.
