\section{File structure}
\subsection{JSON structure}
The JSON files containing the configurations of the various prediction algorithms must be structured in the following way

\subsubsection{Support Vector Machine}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{author}: file author;
	\item \textbf{version}: version of the application with the which the file was created;
	\item \textbf{algorithm}: states which algorithm was used for training, in this particular case "SVM";
	\item \textbf{date}: date on which the file was created;
	\item \textbf{predictors}: list of predictor tags;
	\item \textbf{result}: list of coefficients obtained from training.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Linear Regression}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{author}: file author;
	\item \textbf{version}: version of the application with the which the file was created ;
	\item \textbf{algorithm}: states which algorithm was used for training, in this particular case "Linear Regression";
	\item \textbf{date}: date on which the file was created;
	\item \textbf{predictors}:  list of predictor tags;
	\item \textbf{result}: list of coefficients obtained from training;
	\item \textbf{line}: the equation of the Linear Regression.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{CSV file structure}
The CSV files are structured based on which algorithm must be trained, RL or SVM.
Each column contains the values of the corresponding predictor\glo. The first line  of each column must contain the tag associated to the particular predictor. Depending on the case, one or more columns must be present for the predictors.
