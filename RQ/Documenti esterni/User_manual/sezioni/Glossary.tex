{\Large\textbf{G}\par}
\textbf{Grafana} \\
Open source platform which allows users to monitor data coming from various sources.

{\Large\textbf{M}\par}
\textbf{Machine Learning} \\
Machine learning is the study of algorithms which self improve through experience. Machine learning algorithms build mathematical models based on sample data known as "traning data". 

{\Large\textbf{P}\par}
\textbf{Predictor} \\
It is a function of the data, with the purpose of calculating predictions on one or more variables.

{\Large\textbf{R}\par}
\textbf{RL} \\
It is a method of estimating the expected value of a dependent variable given the values of the indipendent variables. 
It is defined as: $y = \alpha x + \beta $.

{\Large\textbf{S}\par}
\textbf{SVM} \\
It is a supervised machine learning model which uses classification algorithms to evaluate specific problems.
