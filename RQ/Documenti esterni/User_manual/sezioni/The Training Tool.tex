\section{The Training Tool}
Here the appropriate way of using the training tool is explained in detail.

\subsection{Access}
The tool is hosted by a web page and can thus be accessed via browser.

\subsection{Uploading a CSV File in the Tool}
The user will need to feed the tool a CSV file containing properly marked values for the algorithm the user has intention of training.

\subsection{Selection of the Algorithm}
The user will then have to choose between training a support vector machine or a linear regression algorithm with the CSV file he has given to the tool.
Should the user have uploaded training data incompatible with the selected algorithm, an error message will be displayed.
To do this, the user can open a drop-down menu which displays the two algorithms that can be chosen, the preferred algorithm can at this point be selected.

\subsection{Training Operation}
The tool will now be able to perform the training operation, by simply  having the user select the “Confirm” button.
The tool will now have produced a JSON file containing the values needed for use in the plug-in which performs predictions.


\subsection{Obtaining the JSON File}
The user can now select the “download” button and receive the JSON file.
