\section{The training tool}
Here the appropriate way of using the training tool is explained in detail.

\subsection{Access}
The tool is a dynamic web page and can thus be accessed via browser.

\subsection{Uploading a CSV file in the tool}
The user will need to feed the tool a CSV file containing properly marked values for the algorithm the user has intention of training.

This can be done by selecting the "Selezionare il file" button, which will open a window from which the user will be able to select the CSV file he has intention of uploading.

\end{figure}
\newpage

\subsection{Selection of the algorithm}
The user will have to choose between training a Support Vector Machine or a Linear Regression algorithm with the CSV file he has given to the tool.

To do this, the user can open a drop-down menu called "Seleziona l'algoritmo" which displays the two algorithms that can be chosen. The preferred algorithm can at this point be selected.

Should the user have uploaded training data incompatible with the selected algorithm, an error message will be displayed on selection of the "Conferma" button.\newline

\subsection{Training operation}
The tool will now be able to perform the training operation by simply  having the user select the “Conferma” button. The tool will now have produced a JSON file containing the values needed for use in the plug-in.

A message will be displayed on selection of the "Conferma" button if the training operation is successfully completed.

\end{figure}  

\subsection{Obtaining the JSON file}
The user can now select the “download” button, which will only appear once the training operation has ended succesfully, and receive the JSON file.
